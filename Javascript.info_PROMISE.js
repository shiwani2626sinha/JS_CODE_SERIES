// PROMISE IS A JS OBJECT THAT LINKS PRODUCING CODE AND CONSUMING CODE
// IT TAKES A FUNCTION AS A PARAMETER WHILE OBJECT CREATION
// FUNCTION IS THE PRODUCER CODE
// FUNCTION HAS TWO PARAMETERS - RESOLVE / REJECT
// ONCE FUNCTION EXECUTION IS COMPLETED, IF THERE'S AN ERROR, IT CALLS REJECT CODE ELSE RESOLVE CODE


// HOW TO CREATE A PROMISE - 
let promise = new Promise(function(resolve, reject) {
 // this is some random producer code
  // this is more like a performer

});
